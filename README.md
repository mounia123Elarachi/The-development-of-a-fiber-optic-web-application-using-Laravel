# The-development-of-a-fiber-optic-web-application-using-Laravel
The main objectives of the current work are:

Ensure the management of ADSL offers for the Moroccan Telecom operator.
Allow the customer to choose their preferred offer and validate it by submitting their application through the platform.
Ensure the tracking of customer orders (ADSL offers).
************************** Peojzct **************************************
My project consisted of implementing an application for managing ADSL offers for the Moroccan Telecom operator, specifically for Moroccan Telecom customers. My work resulted in the design and development of a prototype for the platform.

This platform should allow the general public to access a web application containing information about ADSL offers for the Moroccan Telecom operator.

The development of this platform highlighted a set of functional, organizational, and technical requirements to create a system that meets the needs of the users.
